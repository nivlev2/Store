# Server 
In this project i built a store, i used Node.js to build the server.
I built the server in such a way so when I send http request I will receive the data from the client exactly how i want it.

# Client
In the client side used React,Redux and some other libraries.
I didnt used Redux for all the states but only the states that I wanted to access them frequently.
